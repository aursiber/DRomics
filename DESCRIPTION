Description: DRomics provides several functions for dose-response (or concentration-response) characterization from omic data. It is especially dedicated to omic data obtained using a typical dose-response design, favoring a great number of tested doses (or concentrations) rather than a great number of replicates. DRomics provides functions 1) to check and normalize data, 2) to select monotonic or biphasic significant responses, 3) to choose the best-fit model among a predefined family of monotonic and biphasic models to describe each significant response and 4) to derive a sensitivity value (a benchmark dose or concentration) and a typology of response from each fitted curve.
