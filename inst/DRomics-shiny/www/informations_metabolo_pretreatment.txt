A basic procedure for the pre-treatment of metabolomic data could be as follows:
1) retrieving of values data using half minimum method (i.e. half of the minimum value found for a metabolite across all samples)
2) log-transformation of values
3) scaling to the total intensity (i.e. normalization by sum of signals in each sample)

For more information and options about pre-treatment of metabolomic data, see for example Liggi et al. 2018.
