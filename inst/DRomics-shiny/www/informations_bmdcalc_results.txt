A table is provided reporting the results of the fit and BMD computation on 
each selected item sorted in the ascending order of the adjusted p-values 
returned by the item selection step. The given results are: 

- id: the item identifier
- irow: the row number in the initial dataset
- adjpvalue: the adjusted p-values returned by the item selection step
- model: the best model fitted
- nbpar: the number of parameters of this best model; b, c, d, e, and f, the 
  model parameter values (see Larras et al. for their interpretation)
- SDres: the residual standard deviation of the best model
- typology: the class of typology (twelve class typology as described in the 
  dose response modelling step)
- BMD.zSD: the BMD_zSD value
- BMD.xfold: the BMD_xfold value
